# About

Hello there. This is my blog where I share the barely coherent meanderings of a somewhat worldy software engineer.

My name is Krisztián Szabó, a software engineer who resides in Hungary and is interested in anything that has to do with software and things that make sand produce interesting side effects. In terms of my background I have roughly a decade of professional experience in C++ and Java both of which are my primary languages, but I also dabble with Python, Kotlin, Rust, Go and TypeScript.

I'm currently employed as a technical lead at HTEC and not actively looking for work - but hey, if you have something interesting going on <a href="mailto:sz.krisztian96@gmail.com">message me</a>, who knows.
Probably should also say at this point nothing that is written on this blog reflects the views of my employer, it's all coming out my noggin.
